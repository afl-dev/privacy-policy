Privacy Policy for the mobile application “Shopping List STAT”**
Effective date:  December 10, 2025


      1. General information

1.1. This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) explains what data is processed by the mobile application “Shopping List STAT” (the “Application”), how this data is used and protected, and what rights you have as a user.

1.2. The “Developer” in this Policy means the entity listed as the publisher/developer of the Application on its Google Play Store listing.
Privacy contact e-mail: **[head.stat@gmail.com](mailto:head.stat@gmail.com)**.

1.3. By installing and using the Application, you confirm that you have read and accepted this Policy.

1.4. The Application is designed for managing shopping lists and related notes, including voice notes and image attachments.


      2. Data we process

By default, the Application works locally on your device and **does not collect data for advertising or marketing analytics purposes**.
Data processing is limited to:

* the core functionality of the Application;
* crash diagnostics through Firebase Crashlytics, as described in section 2.4; and
* support requests you choose to send.

The Application does **not** contain advertising banners, ad networks, or advertising SDKs.

       2.1. Data you provide manually

We may process the following data only when you actively provide it:

* **E-mail address** — when you contact us for support (for example, when you send us an email from your mail client).
* **Message content and attachments** — the text of your request, screenshots, and any files you choose to attach.

We receive this data only when you choose to contact us.

       2.2. Voice notes and microphone use

The Application uses the `android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO` permission to enable voice note recording.

* Voice recording starts **only after your explicit action** (tapping the record button inside the Application).
* The Application **does not** perform hidden, background, or continuous recording of ambient audio.
* The recorded audio file is used solely to display and play back the corresponding voice note within the Application.

**Storage of voice notes**

* Voice notes are stored locally on your device in the Application’s private storage.
* The Developer does **not** have remote access to these audio files and does **not** copy them to its own servers.
* You can delete individual notes at any time via the Application interface, or delete the Application from your device, which will remove all related local data (including audio).

If you choose to export or share an audio file yourself (for example, via email or a messaging app), further processing of that file is governed by the privacy rules of the respective service.

       2.3. Technical data

During operation, the Application may process certain technical data, such as:

* device model and operating system version;
* language settings and date/time format;
* information about which features of the Application are used (only as necessary to display the interface correctly and store data locally).

This information is used only within the Application or in aggregated form for diagnostics as described in section 2.4 and is **not** automatically sent to the Developer outside of crash reports.

       2.4. Crash diagnostics (Firebase Crashlytics)

To analyze crashes and improve the stability of the Application, we use **Firebase Crashlytics** provided by Google LLC.

When the Application crashes, Crashlytics may automatically collect and send the following technical data to Google’s servers:

* crash information: stack traces, error codes, and app state at the time of the crash;
* technical information about your device and OS: device model, operating system version, app version, approximate configuration (such as available memory);
* technical identifiers related to the app installation (for example, Firebase Installation ID, Crashlytics Installation UUID);
* limited location-related information that can be derived from the IP address (used only in aggregated form, for example, by country or region).

This data is used **solely for**:

* identifying and fixing bugs;
* measuring how many users are affected by specific issues;
* improving the quality and stability of the Application.

Firebase Crashlytics retains crash reports and associated identifiers for a limited period (typically up to 90 days) before removing them from live and backup systems, in accordance with Firebase’s data retention policies.

Crashlytics is **not** used for advertising or direct marketing. The processing of data by Crashlytics is governed by Google’s “Privacy and Security in Firebase” documentation, available on the Firebase website.


      3. Android permissions used

The Application may request the following permissions:

       3.1. RECORD_AUDIO

* **Purpose:** to allow you to record voice notes on your initiative.
* **Data:** your voice/sound recorded within the voice notes feature.
* **Storage:** locally on your device in the Application’s private storage.
* There is no hidden or background recording; the Application does not transfer audio to the Developer or any third party.

       3.2. CAMERA (access to the device camera)

* **Purpose:** to let you take a photo directly from the Application and attach it to:

* a product item card in your shopping list; or
* a note created in the Application.
* **Data:** the image that you actively capture via the Application’s camera interface.
* **Storage:** the photo is stored locally in the Application’s storage on your device (or in the system media storage if you explicitly choose this via the operating system).
* The Application does **not** use the camera for any hidden or background recording, does not perform face recognition, and does not use captured photos for advertising, analytics, or profiling.

       3.3. Access to photos and gallery

(for example, via the system photo picker or `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES` / `READ_MEDIA_VIDEO` / `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`, depending on the Android version)

* **Purpose:** to allow you to select an existing photo from your gallery and attach it to:

* a product item card; or
* a note within the Application.
* **Data:** only the images that you explicitly select.
* **Storage:**

* where necessary, a copy of the selected image may be stored in the Application’s local storage in order to support the corresponding feature;
* the Application does **not** scan your entire gallery, does **not** bulk-upload photos, and does **not** automatically send images to the Developer or third parties.
* The use of images is limited to displaying them inside the Application together with the related product item or note.

       3.4. POST_NOTIFICATIONS

* **Purpose:** to display notifications on your device (for example, reminders about shopping lists or tasks).
* **Data:** notification text and parameters are generated locally.
* Notifications are not used for advertising.

       3.5. SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM and RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED

* **Purpose:** to ensure proper operation of reminders and scheduled notifications, including after a device reboot.
* These permissions are not used to track user behavior and do not involve sharing data with third parties.

       3.6. INTERNET

* **Purpose:**

* to send support emails (via an external email client);
* possible future functional updates (for example, synchronization explicitly enabled by the user).
* The Application does **not** use the internet to show ads, collect commercial analytics, or track users.

       3.7. Other permissions

Aside from the explicitly listed cases above (microphone, camera, user-selected images, notifications, reminders, limited service-related internet access, and crash diagnostics via Firebase Crashlytics), the Application does **not** request access to location, contacts, SMS, call logs, or other sensitive data.


      4. Purposes of processing

We use data for the following purposes:

* to provide the core functionality of the Application (shopping lists, text notes, voice notes, image attachments, reminders);
* to handle user support requests and feedback;
* to improve the stability and usability of the Application (for example, fixing bugs based on crash reports and user requests).

The Application does **not** use data for:

* advertising;
* user profiling;
* sharing data with third parties for marketing purposes.


      5. Legal bases for processing (for EEA / GDPR users)

For users in the European Economic Area (EEA), data may be processed on the following legal bases:

* **Performance of a contract** — when processing is necessary to provide the Application’s functionality (managing lists, voice notes, image attachments, reminders).
* **Consent** — when you actively send us an email or otherwise provide additional information.
* **Legitimate interests of the Developer** — maintaining and improving the Application, provided that such interests do not override your rights and freedoms.


      6. Data retention and deletion

       6.1. E-mail and support communication

Stored on secure servers of the email provider (Google) for as long as necessary to handle your request, and no longer than **180 days** after the request is closed, unless a longer period is required by law. Upon your request, emails can be deleted earlier.

       6.2. Voice notes, images, and local Application data

Stored only on your device and available until:

* you delete the corresponding note, image, or list; or
* you uninstall the Application from your device.


      7. Data sharing with third parties

7.1. The Developer does **not** sell or share personal data with third parties for marketing or advertising purposes.

7.2. Data may be disclosed only:

* when required by applicable law or by a valid request from competent authorities; or
* when you intentionally share data yourself (for example, by sending an email with logs or screenshots).


      8. Data security

The Developer takes reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect data, including:

* using secure communication channels (TLS) for email transmission;
* restricting access to the support mailbox (authentication and, where applicable, two-factor authentication);
* minimizing data collection — the Application does not request unnecessary permissions and does not collect data unrelated to its functionality.

However, no method of data transmission or storage can be fully secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security of your information.


      9. Children’s privacy

9.1. The Application may be used by children; however, it does **not** request date of birth and does **not** intentionally collect personal data from children.

9.2. Voice notes, images, and lists are stored locally on the device and are accessible to anyone who has access to the device.

9.3. If you are a parent or legal guardian and believe that your child has provided us with personal data (for example, via email), please contact us at **[head.stat@gmail.com](mailto:head.stat@gmail.com)**, and we will delete such information within a reasonable time.
