Data Deletion Request – Shopping List STA
Last updated: 14 August 2025

This page explains how users of Shopping List STA (developed by Alex STA) can request permanent deletion of personal data collected by the app and its integrated services

Step-by-Step Instructions
1) Compose an e-mail to head.stat@gmail.com with the subject line:
“Data Deletion Request – Shopping List STA”.

2) In the body of the message include at least one identifier so we can locate your records:
• Your Google Advertising ID (AAID) or App Set ID.
Android: Settings → Privacy → Ads → Delete Advertising ID
(please note the ID before deleting).
• Your device model and Android version.
• Date/time of your most recent use of the app.
• Any crash or support-ticket IDs you may have received (from Firebase Crashlytics or our support).

3) (Optional) Specify what to erase (e.g., all data; advertising/analytics only; support messages).

4) Identity check: we may request additional details solely to verify the request.

5) Confirmation & timeline: we will confirm within 7 days. Deletion will be completed
within 30 days of confirmation and we will notify you when it is finished.


What Will Be Deleted (within 30 days of a verified request)

• Device identifiers — AAID, App Set ID, installation/instance IDs.
• Network & approximate-location data — IP address, MCC/MNC, country/region inferred from IP.
• App-interaction data — ad views, clicks, session length, basic in-app events.
• Crash & performance logs — stack traces, ANR reports.
Note: Firebase Crashlytics retains dashboard data about 90 days by default; we submit the erasure
and the provider completes deletion under its terms.
• User-support data — your e-mails and attachments (deleted when the ticket is closed or on request).

Third-party processors we’ll notify on your behalf
We forward your verified deletion request (with the identifiers you provided) to:
• Appodeal — ad mediation & measurement (uses IDs for ad serving/measurement).
• Yandex AppMetrica — analytics & attribution (uses IDs and app events).
• Firebase Crashlytics (Google) — crash reporting (uses crash logs and device/OS info).
These providers erase matching data they processed for us according to their data-processing terms.

Local data on your device
Lists and settings stored only on your device are not collected by us and cannot be erased by us.
To remove them locally: Android → Settings → Apps → Shopping List STA → Storage → Clear data,
or uninstall the app.


What May Be Retained
Certain information may remain only in aggregated or anonymised form that no longer identifies you, for lawful business analytics or legal compliance
