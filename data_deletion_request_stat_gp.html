  Data Deletion Request – Shopping List STAT  
  Last updated: 10 December 2025  

This page explains how users of   Shopping List STAT   (developed by   Alex STA  ) can request permanent deletion of personal data that may be stored   off your device  , such as crash reports and support e-mails.

The app does   not   create user accounts and does   not   use advertising SDKs or analytics platforms. The only data stored outside your device are:

- crash and performance logs in   Firebase Crashlytics  ; and
- e-mails and attachments that you send to our support address.

All lists, notes, voice recordings, and photos you create inside the app are stored   only on your device   and are not collected by us.

    How to submit a data deletion request

1.   Compose an e-mail  
Send an e-mail to:   [head.stat@gmail.com](mailto:head.stat@gmail.com)  
Use the subject line:

>   “Data Deletion Request – Shopping List STAT”  

2.   Provide information to help us locate your data  

Please include as much of the following as possible, so we can find and delete the relevant records:

- Your   device model   (for example: “Samsung Galaxy A52”).
- Your   Android version   (for example: “Android 14”).
- The   app version   of Shopping List STAT (from the app’s Settings or from Google Play).
- Approximate   date and time (with time zone)   of:

- your most recent use of the app, and/or
- the most recent   crash   you experienced.
- The   e-mail address   you used if you previously contacted our support.
- Any   error IDs   or references you received from our support (if applicable).

We understand that you may not know every detail — provide what you can. We will use this information to search for related records in Firebase Crashlytics and in our support mailbox.

3.   (Optional) Specify the scope of deletion  

In your e-mail, you may specify what should be erased:

-   All data   stored off-device;
-   Crash logs only   (Firebase Crashlytics);
-   Support messages only   (e-mails and attachments).

If you do not specify, we will treat your request as “delete   all   personal data stored off-device for this app”.

4.   Identity verification  

To protect your privacy, we may request additional details   only   to verify that the request relates to your own data (for example, confirming device model or prior support messages). We will not use this information for any other purpose.

5.   Confirmation and timeline  

- We will confirm receipt of your request   within 7 days  .
- Once we have verified your request, we will start the deletion process.
- Deletion will normally be   completed within 30 days   of confirmation, and we will notify you when it is finished.

    What will be deleted (within 30 days of a verified request)

After we verify your request, we will delete or request deletion of the following data associated with your use of   Shopping List STAT  :

1.   Crash and performance logs (Firebase Crashlytics)  

This includes, to the extent they can be associated with your request:

- crash reports and stack traces;
- app version, device model, OS version;
- technical identifiers used by Crashlytics (for example, Crashlytics Installation UUID, Firebase Installation ID);
- limited network and region information (for example, IP-derived country or region).

Firebase Crashlytics typically retains crash reports and related identifiers for about   90 days   before removing them from live and backup systems according to its own retention policy. ([Firebase][2])

After we process your request, we will:

- delete or anonymize any matching crash data that we can control; and
- submit the necessary deletion actions within Firebase Crashlytics for the relevant installation identifiers and crash sessions, where technically possible.

2.   User-support data (e-mails and attachments)  

- Your e-mails to   [head.stat@gmail.com](mailto:head.stat@gmail.com)   relating to Shopping List STAT;
- any attachments (screenshots, logs, or files) you sent us.

These e-mails are stored on secure servers of our e-mail provider (Google). We will delete:

- the support thread(s) relating to your request; and
- any associated attachments.

In our standard practice, support messages are deleted no later than   180 days   after the ticket is closed. If you request deletion earlier, we will erase them sooner as part of your data deletion request.

3.   Other server-side technical logs (if any)  

If we happen to maintain any additional server logs that could reasonably identify you (for example, temporary security logs linked to your support interactions), we will remove or anonymize these records as part of the deletion process.

    Third-party processors we will notify on your behalf

As part of fulfilling your data deletion request, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that third-party processors used by   Shopping List STAT   delete or anonymize corresponding data.

Currently, the only such processor that may receive data from the app is:

-   Firebase Crashlytics (Google LLC)   – crash reporting and diagnostics.

Where technically possible, we will submit deletion or removal actions within the Firebase Crashlytics console for data associated with your request.

    Local data on your device

The Application stores the following   only on your device  :

- shopping lists and items;
- text notes;
- voice notes and audio recordings;
- photos attached to items or notes;
- local settings and preferences.

These data are   not   collected by us and are   not   transmitted off your device. Because of this, we cannot delete them remotely.

To remove these data from your device, you can:

-   Clear app data   on Android:

> Settings → Apps → Shopping List STAT → Storage → Clear data

or

-   Uninstall the app  :

> Settings → Apps → Shopping List STAT → Uninstall

Both actions remove local app data from your device.

    What may be retained

In some cases, certain information may remain only in   aggregated   or   anonymized   form that no longer allows us (or our providers) to identify you, for example:

- aggregated crash statistics;
- high-level metrics (such as total number of crashes per app version).

Such aggregated data may be retained for lawful purposes such as:

- maintaining service stability and security;
- understanding overall app performance;
- meeting legal or regulatory requirements.
